## The BuB (Break up Buddy) 

### This is a project that creates a custom calendar designed to help you navigate the tricky timing of breakups. It highlights ideal moments, such as full moons and Mercury retrogrades, while cautioning you against ill-timed breakups on holidays, birthdays, or just before major gift-giving occasions. Simply enter your significant other's birthday and the year you'd like to explore, and BuB will guide you on when to break upâ€”and when to hold off.
